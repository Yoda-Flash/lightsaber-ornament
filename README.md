# lightsaber-ornament
A lightsaber ornament made for Hack Club's Hacky Holidays!

At first, I wanted to make a Yoda ornament PCB, but I realized that it would only look good with green colored lights. Upon further thought, I realized that Lightsabers would look good in nearly any color, which made it perfect as an ornament. Hence, I decided to make this lightsaber ornament PCB, to bring joy to all Star Wars lovers during the holidays!
